Exercise 02d In this exercise we are going to compare the number of
operations in two alternatives for computing a morphological dilation
with structuring element.
Let B be the MxM square structuring element.
Let C be the 1xM 1−D horizontal structuring element:
Let D be the Mx1 1−D vertical structuring element.

Note: − The number of pixels of B is MxM
      − The number of pixels of C and D is M.
'X' denotes the origin of coordinates or center of the
structuring element. B, C and D are centered structuring
elements.

It can be observed that the following property holds:
B = dilate_C (D) = dilate_D (C).

Estimate the number or 'max' operations that must be computed in
order to process a NxN square input image using the following
alternatives:
dilate_B (I))
dilate_C(dilate_D (I)))

Border effects should not be considered for simplicity, i.e.,
all image pixels should be treated in the same manner.
